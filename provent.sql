Over time, chronic sleep disruptions can make you feel tired, and lead to many health problems.</p><p>	The Provent Nasal Device fits over both nostrils and uses a proprietary MicroValve design that creates pressure which keeps the airway open. As you inhale, airflow is nearly unobstructed, allowing for normal breathing. As you exhale, the MicroValve closes, directing air through small air channels, increasing resistance. This resistance creates EPAP (Expiratory Positive Airway Pressure), which props open the airway until you inhale again.</p><p>	Provent works much like CPAP therapy, except instead of an external machine, your own breathing creates the pressure that keeps your airway open. Like CPAP, it needs to be worn every night to effectively relieve symptoms of OSA. It may take time before you start to feel like you&rsquo;re sleeping normally and waking up refreshed.</p><p>	For many patients, the Provent Device is an effective treatment for OSA while allowing them more freedom to travel, enjoy their sleep partner, and live their lives.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.proventtherapy.com/how_to_use\">Get more details on how to use this CPAP alternative.</a></p><p>	In a recent market research study, Provent users were asked to rate Provent Therapy and indicate what they liked about it<span style=\"font-size: 10px\"><sup>3</sup></span>:</p><ul>	<li>		No machine or mask involved (84%)</li>	<li>		Convenient for travel (80%)</li>	<li>		It&rsquo;s discreet; I am comfortable wearing it with my sleep partner (51%)</li>	<li>		My snoring has improved (50%)</li></ul><p>	We also heard the following comments from satisfied Provent Therapy patients<span style=\"font-size: 10px\"><sup>4</sup></span>:</p><blockquote>	&ldquo;CPAP compared to Provent, there&rsquo;s no comparison.

What is Provent Therapy?<a name=\"a1\"></a></h3><p class=\"indent\">	PROVENT Sleep Apnea Therapy is a simple, non-invasive treatment for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The Provent Nasal Device uses a valve design that attaches over the nostrils and is secured in place with hypoallergenic adhesive. The valve opens and closes, redirecting air through small holes to create resistance upon breathing out. Because it&#39;s a small, single use, disposable device, it&#39;s also discreet and very convenient.</p><h3>	2. What is EPAP?<a name=\"a2\"></a></h3><p>	Provent Sleep Apnea Therapy utilizes a proprietary MicroValve technology developed by Ventus Medical. The device attaches over the nostrils with a hypoallergenic adhesive. During inhalation, the valve opens, allowing the user to breathe in freely. When exhaling, the valve closes and air passing through the nose is directed through two small air channels. This increases the pressure in the airway (called EPAP or expiratory positive airway pressure). This maintains pressure in the airway until the start of the next inspiration and helps to keep it open.</p><h3>	3. How does Provent Therapy work?<a name=\"a3\"></a></h3><p class=\"indent\">	PROVENT Therapy utilizes a proprietary MicroValve technology developed by Ventus Medical. The device attaches over the nostrils. During inhalation, the valve opens, allowing the user to breathe in freely. When exhaling, the valve closes and air passing through the nose is directed through two small air channels. This increases the pressure in the airway and helps to keep it open.</p><h3>	4. Is Provent Therapy FDA-cleared?<a name=\"a4\"></a></h3><p class=\"indent\">	Provent therapy was cleared by the US FDA for the treatment of OSA.</p><h3>	5. Is Provent Therapy right for me?<a name=\"a5\"></a></h3><p class=\"indent\">	Provent Therapy may not be appropriate for everyone. If you have been diagnosed with OSA and you are considering Provent Therapy, you should speak to your physician to evaluate your individual medical needs.<span _fck_bookmark=\"1\" style=\"display: none\">&nbsp;</span></p><h3>	6. Does Provent Therapy stop snoring?<a name=\"a6\"></a></h3><p>	Clinical studies have shown that 83% of patients experienced a snoring reduction with Provent Therapy<span style=\"font-size: 10px\"><sup>1</sup></span>. Among OSA patients that snore, Provent Therapy virtually eliminated snoring in 58% of patients<span style=\"font-size: 10px\"><sup>2</sup></span>.</p><h3>	7. Why is it important to treat obstructive sleep apnea?<a name=\"a7\"></a></h3><p class=\"indent\">	There is no cure for obstructive sleep apnea. Untreated OSA has a number of potential serious side effects. These include excessive daytime sleepiness, increased risk of high blood pressure, heart attack, stroke, diabetes, depression, increased risk or worsening of heart failure, and increased likelihood of driving or work-related accidents.</p><h3>	8. How is Provent Therapy different from CPAP therapy?<a name=\"a8\"></a></h3><p class=\"indent\">	CPAP increases the pressure on both inspiration and expiration, while Provent Therapy increases the pressure on expiration only. CPAP increases pressure in the airway using forced air, while Provent Therapy uses the patient&rsquo;s own breathing to create pressure during exhalation.</p><h3>	9. Can Provent Therapy replace my CPAP machine?<a name=\"a9\"></a></h3><p>	If you are not using your CPAP machine all night, every night then you might ask your physician about non-CPAP alternatives including Provent Therapy. Only you and your physician can decide what therapy is best for you.&nbsp;If you want more information to take to your doctor, download and print this <a href=\"http://www.proventtherapy.com//images/uploads/msm0174-01_take_to_your_doctor.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">information guide</a> and&nbsp;<span _fck_bookmark=\"1\" style=\"display: none\">&nbsp;</span><a href=\"http://www.proventtherapy.com//images/uploads/msm0217-01_a_generic_do_form.pdf\">doctor order form</a>.&nbsp;</p><h3>	10.

OSA is a chronic condition, which means it does not resolve spontaneously, and is rarely cured.</p><p>	When people with OSA fall asleep, they can stop breathing for a few seconds to a minute. These interruptions happen throughout the night, at least five times an hour. Afterward, normal breathing starts again, sometimes with a loud snort or choking sound.</p><p>	When breathing pauses or becomes shallow, the OSA sufferer usually moves out of deep sleep into light sleep&mdash;or has a brief awakening&mdash;which they may not remember. As a result of these disruptions, sleep quality is worsened, causing tiredness during the day. In fact, obstructive sleep apnea is one of the leading causes of daytime sleepiness.</p><h3>	Symptoms and Signs of Obstructive Sleep Apnea<span style=\"font-size: 10px\"><sup>2</sup></span></h3><p>	Loud frequent snoring, increased age and obesity with increased neck size are the three best predictors of having OSA. If your partner complains about your snoring or says that you gasp for breath during the night (especially if you make a loud snorting or choking sound), this is a sign you might have obstructive sleep apnea. Other symptoms may include one or more of the following:</p><ul>	<li>		Sleepiness during the day</li>	<li>		Morning headaches</li>	<li>		Memory, learning, or concentration problems</li>	<li>		Irritability, depression, mood swings, or personality changes</li>	<li>		Needing to urinate at night</li>	<li>		Waking up with a dry throat</li></ul><p>	Of course, not all people who show these symptoms have obstructive sleep apnea. If you experience these symptoms, tell your doctor, who will review your history, and possibly perform non-invasive tests to make a diagnosis. Obstructive sleep apnea ranges in severity, and can be mild, moderate, or severe. And while there is no cure for obstructive sleep apnea, there is treatment that can help reduce snoring, and help you get better sleep.</p><h3>	What Causes Obstructive Sleep Apnea<span style=\"font-size: 10px\"><sup>2</sup></span>?</h3><p>	People with OSA tend to have a narrower or more collapsible airway than normal, often at the base of the tongue and soft palate. During sleep, the normal relaxation of muscles in the throat can cause the tongue and palate to fall backwards, further closing the already narrowed airway. Obstructive sleep apnea can be caused (or made worse) by:</p><ul>	<li>		Obesity: Extra fat tissue in the neck can narrow the airway, which makes it harder to keep open</li>	<li>		Large tongue and tonsils: These can obstruct the airway, making it harder for air to pass through</li>	<li>		Getting older: For reasons not fully understood, sleep apnea tends to increase with age</li>	<li>		Head and neck shape: Some people have a naturally small airway opening in the mouth and throat due the structure of their bones</li></ul><h3>	Health risks of Obstructive Sleep Apnea<span style=\"font-size: 10px\"><sup>2</sup></span>.</h3><p>	Left untreated, Obstructive Sleep Apnea can trigger the release of stress hormones, change how your body uses energy, and, of course, make you feel tired and sleepy during the day. But even if you don&rsquo;t have daytime sleepiness, obstructive sleep apnea still puts you at higher risk for:</p><ul>	<li>		High blood pressure</li>	<li>		Heart attack, heart failure</li>	<li>		Stroke</li>	<li>		Irregular heartbeats</li>	<li>		Diabetes</li>	<li>		Obesity</li>	<li>		Driving or work-related accidents</li></ul><h3>	Treatment for Obstructive Sleep Apnea</h3><p>	In addition to lifestyle changes and surgery, CPAP therapy has been an accepted treatment for OSA. A CPAP machine is a blower that connects by a tube to a mask that fits over your mouth or nose, blowing air so that a continuous pressure in the airway is maintained. This constant pressure keeps the airway from collapsing allowing normal breathing.</p><p>	Some people have difficulty using a CPAP machine and others don&rsquo;t like to travel with their CPAP equipment.

Here, you can meet Angela and Maria, and see what a difference Provent Therapy made in their lives.</p><h4>	MARIA</h4><p>	<strong>Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) Patient</strong></p><p>	<video height=\"280\" id=\"mariavid\" poster=\"http://www.proventtherapy.com/video/maria.jpg\" src=\"http://www.proventtherapy.com/video/maria.m4v\" tabindex=\"0\" width=\"372\"></video><script>jwplayer(\"mariavid\").setup({    flashplayer: \"http://www.proventtherapy.com/jwplayer/player.swf\"  });</script></p><p>	A retired professor, author, amateur photographer, and certified Braille transcriber, Maria was determined not to let obstructive sleep apnea slow her down. But when diet, exercise, and weight loss weren&rsquo;t enough to treat her symptoms, she reluctantly turned to other options.</p><p>	Initially prescribed CPAP therapy, Maria eventually discontinued it, finding the machine intolerable and cumbersome. Over the course of five years, she also struggled with oral appliances, but daytime sleepiness and other symptoms continued. Frustrated, she asked about newer therapies, and was finally prescribed Provent in July, 2009.</p><p>	Since starting on Provent Therapy, Maria has experienced a nearly complete resolution of her OSA. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m able to sleep through the night, and have a lot more energy during the day,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;I now use PROVENT every night.&rdquo; With newfound zest for life, she&rsquo;s resumed her active lifestyle, which includes dog sledding, zip-lining, and climbing Machu Picchu in Peru to celebrate her 73rd birthday.</p><h4>	ANGELA</h4><p>	<strong>Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) Patient</strong></p><p>	<video height=\"280\" id=\"angelavid\" poster=\"http://www.proventtherapy.com/video/angela.jpg\" src=\"http://www.proventtherapy.com/video/angela.m4v\" tabindex=\"0\" width=\"372\"></video><script>jwplayer(\"angelavid\").setup({    flashplayer: \"http://www.proventtherapy.com/jwplayer/player.swf\"  });</script></p><p>	Recently retired from the New York City Department of Education, Angela was looking forward to enjoying her passions, which include dancing, reading, spending time with family, and travel.</p><p>	But obstructive sleep apnea put a damper on her plans. In 2004, she began experiencing symptoms, which included snoring, fatigue, and daytime tiredness. She started treatment using a CPAP machine, but found it extremely challenging to use. The mask left marks on her face each morning, and the cumbersome machine often caused delays at airport security.</p><p>	But then, Angela&rsquo;s doctor gave her samples of Provent Therapy, which led to significant improvement in her OSA symptoms. Angela found PROVENT Therapy to be comfortable and convenient, especially for travel. And she also appreciated the fact that it&rsquo;s disposable, so she no longer had to worry about maintaining and cleaning the device, as she did with CPAP.</p><p>	Today, Angela is more active than ever. &ldquo;With Provent Therapy as my travel companion,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m free to go anywhere.&rdquo;</p><p>	<span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold\">Get started today!</span></p><p>	<span x=\"y\">Provent Therapy is available by prescription only, so you need to ask your doctor if it&rsquo;s right for you.

As hard as it is to see your partner struggling through the night, it&rsquo;s perhaps even more difficult to consider the long-term health risks of untreated OSA, which can include high blood pressure, heart disease, depression and diabetes.</p><p>	Fortunately, OSA can be treated. If your sleep partner suffers from this chronic condition, there are ways you can help him or her get back on the road to better health.</p><h3>	Get the benefit of a good night&rsquo;s sleep.</h3><p>	When your partner experiences sleep disruptions, do you wake up too? Are you bothered by their loud snoring?</p><p>	When your partner is treated with Provent Therapy, it can help you sleep better too. Among OSA patients that snore, Provent Therapy reduced snoring to trace or none in 58%<span style=\"font-size: 10px\"><sup>1</sup></span>. Clinical studies have also shown that 83% of patients experienced a snoring reduction with Provent Therapy<span style=\"font-size: 10px\"><sup>2</sup></span>. Provent Therapy is clinically proven to improve sleep quality and daytime function and is FDA-cleared for the treatment of OSA.</p><h3>	Don&rsquo;t accept compromises.</h3><p>	Is the equipment your partner uses to treat their OSA causing problems with your bedtime routine? Do you sleep in separate rooms or have to modify when or how you sleep?</p><p>	Provent Therapy is a clinically proven alternative to CPAP. It requires no mask, no machines, and no electricity&mdash;making it easy and convenient to use. In fact, in a clinical trial, four out of five OSA patients who were not compliant with CPAP chose to continue treatment with Provent Therapy past their initial trial.</p><p>	With Provent Therapy, you can rest assured that your partner is taking care of their obstructive sleep apnea, as well as helping you both get a peaceful night&rsquo;s sleep.</p><h3>	Do Something.</h3><p>	Help yourself and your sleep partner by encouraging them to try Provent Therapy today. You can be an important part of your partner&rsquo;s success by:</p><ul>	<li>		Sharing the information on this website with your sleep partner</li>	<li>		Encouraging your sleep partner to talk to their doctor about Provent Therapy</li>	<li>		Asking your partner to register for our 10-night trial</li>	<li>		Encouraging your partner to stick with Provent Therapy, even if it takes several days to get used to it</li>	<li>		Reading the instructions together so you have the same expectations</li></ul><h3>	Watch and learn how Provent Therapy works</h3><p>	<video height=\"280\" id=\"vid\" poster=\"http://www.proventtherapy.com/video/how_it_works.jpg\" src=\"http://www.proventtherapy.com/video/how_it_works.m4v\" tabindex=\"0\" width=\"372\"></video></p><p>	Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is characterized by repeated obstruction of the airway during sleep, which can lead to sleep disruption. Left untreated, OSA is associated to many health problems, including daytime sleepiness, heart attack, and high blood pressure.</p><p>	Traditionally, OSA is most often treated with a CPAP machine, which uses forced air to create pressure that keeps the airway open. This allows the patient to breathe more normally and avoid sleep disruption.</p><p>	Provent Therapy also uses pressure to keep the airway open. But instead of a machine, it uses the user&rsquo;s natural breathing to create pressure to keep the airway open. Like CPAP, Provent Therapy needs to be worn every night.</p><p>	Users apply the Provent Device over both nostrils right before they fall asleep. The device allows the patient to inhale freely. During exhalation, the air is directed through two small channels, which creates resistance and pressure that keeps the airway open. While awake, they should breathe through their mouth while breathing out; they will naturally switch to nasal breathing once asleep.</p><p>	In addition to better sleep, Provent Therapy has proven to improve daytime alertness, energy, and concentration, as well as reduce snoring in 83% of patients. Provent Therapy is an effective treatment for obstructive sleep apnea, allowing couples to sleep together more peacefully, and live their lives without compromise.</p><h3>	You can help your sleep partner succeed.</h3><p>	We&rsquo;ve found that having a supportive sleep partner increases the chance for patient success. Please encourage your partner to <a href=\"http://www.proventtherapy.com/10_night_trial\">sign up for our 10-night trial</a> of Provent Therapy today.</p><p>	It may take some time for them to get used to wearing the Provent Device. If you notice your partner needs help or is having difficulty adjusting, remind them of the benefits of treating their OSA and encourage them to stick with it.

Some people get used to it right away; others may take up to a week or more to get used to it. <a href=\"http://www.proventtherapy.com/tips_for_success\">Here are some tips that Provent Therapy users have found useful</a>.</p><h3>	What to Expect</h3><p>	Though Provent Therapy seems simple, there are a few things to know in order to use it properly. To effectively relieve symptoms of OSA, the Provent Device needs to be worn every night, and certain steps need to be followed, which we&rsquo;ve outlined in the <a href=\"http://www.proventtherapy.com/what_to_expect\">&quot;What to Expect&quot; section of this Web site</a>.</p><h3>	Current Provent Users</h3><p>	<strong>Apply the Provent Device right before you fall asleep</strong>. Once applied, breathe out normally through your mouth (not through the device) when awake. You will naturally switch to nasal breathing once you&rsquo;re asleep.</p><p>	<strong>You should notice resistance when you exhale through your nose</strong>. This is normal, and means the device is working. But remember that while you are awake and trying to fall asleep, you should breathe out through your mouth. This will feel a lot more comfortable than breathing through the device.</p><p>	<strong>OSA is a chronic condition that requires treatment every night, so remember to make Provent Therapy a part of your bedtime routine</strong>. Provent Therapy is intended for single use only, so use a fresh set every night. You should store them in a cool, dry place (like near your bedside table).</p><p>	<strong>Some people adjust to Provent Therapy right away; others need more time</strong>.

Treating your sleep apnea can help you achieve a healthier and more productive day. And with Provent Therapy, you should experience less apnea-related snoring. If this is your first time trying Provent, you may get used to the device immediately. Fantastic! If you don&rsquo;t, stick with it. Wearing Provent Therapy may take some time to get used to.</p><h3>	Important steps before starting:</h3><ol>	<li>		The device works by making it harder to breathe out. This creates pressure, which keeps your airway open</li>	<li>		Breathe out through your mouth (not though the device) when awake. You&rsquo;ll naturally breathe through the device when you fall asleep</li>	<li>		It may take time to get used to wearing the device. Give it a few days; it should feel a lot better</li>	<li>		Take it off. If you wake up during the night and feel uncomfortable, just take it off. Try again tomorrow; it should get better</li></ol><p>	<strong>Need help?</strong> We want you to be successful, so if you have any questions, or need help, call us at 1-888-SLP-WELL (1-888-757-9355)</p><p>	Please refer to the <a href=\"http://www.proventtherapy.com//images/uploads/lbl0181-01_proventpatientphysicianifu.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Provent Instructions</a> for additional information.</p>',19,0,'tips.template.php'),

The Provent Device uses pressure to keep the airway open during sleep, but instead of forced air, it&rsquo;s powered by your own breathing.</p><p>	Each Provent Device features a breakthrough MicroValve design that creates resistance when you exhale. This Expiratory Positive Airway Pressure (EPAP) helps treat your apnea, reducing snoring and helping you get a more refreshing night&rsquo;s sleep.</p><p>	The device attaches over each nostril with a hypoallergenic adhesive, and is designed for single use. So use a fresh set every night. Apply it right before you go to sleep, and follow these steps:</p><p>	<strong>STEP 1 &ndash; Inhale</strong></p><p>	Inhale through your mouth or through the device, whichever is more comfortable for you to fall asleep.</p><p>	<strong>STEP 2 &ndash; Exhale</strong></p><p>	Breathe out through your mouth.&nbsp; If you try breathing through your nose, notice the significant resistance. This is normal, and tells you the device is working.&nbsp; And remember, it&rsquo;s recommended to just breathe out through your mouth while awake.&nbsp; You will naturally switch to nasal breathing once you&rsquo;re asleep, effectively &ldquo;turning on&rdquo; the device.</p><p>	<strong>STEP 3 &ndash; Relax</strong></p><p>	Do not engage in any activity while wearing the device&mdash;just try to fall asleep once you&rsquo;ve applied it.</p><p>	Keep a glass of water near your bedside, in case you wake up with a dry mouth.</p><p>	<strong>STEP 4 &ndash; REPEAT</strong></p><p>	The Provent Device should be worn every night.&nbsp; If you have trouble using the device, keep trying. Many users just need time to get used to it.&nbsp; This is normal.</p><p>	<strong>STEP 5 &ndash; COMMIT</strong></p><p>	Use all the devices provided in the pack. Eventually, Provent Therapy should become part of your nightly routine.</p><p>	Need more help using Provent? <a href=\"http://96.31.169.199//images/uploads/lbl0173-01_a_artwork,_provent_application_and_acclimation_guide.pdf\">Download this Application and Usage Guide</a>.</p>',19,0,'home.template.php'),
